## üß© Overview

The **Ransomware Detection and Prevention Tool** is a real-time monitoring system designed to **detect, analyze, and isolate ransomware or malware activities** before they can harm your system.  
It continuously observes OS-level activities, analyzes behavioral patterns, and automatically quarantines suspicious files to prevent further infection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äì The tool keeps track of file operations, process behavior, and system resource usage.  
2. **Behavioral Analysis** ‚Äì Suspicious patterns such as mass file renaming, abnormal CPU or memory spikes, and unauthorized access are detected in real-time.  
3. **Quarantine Mechanism** ‚Äì Once a potential ransomware or malware activity is identified, the related file is **immediately quarantined**.  
4. **Host‚ÄìGuest Analysis** ‚Äì Files are transferred from the **host OS to a guest OS** over a local network for isolated sandbox testing.  
5. **Classification** ‚Äì The guest OS analyzes the file‚Äôs behavior and classifies it as **ransomware**, **malware**, or **safe**.
